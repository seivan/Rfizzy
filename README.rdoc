= Rfizzy http://travis-ci.org/seivan/Rfizzy.png

A ruby library utilizing Redis for; 
* Full text search engine with Redis.
* Tagging library
* Social Graph with friends, followers, followees and etc. 


Works in all Ruby projects, regardless of ORM as long as an attribute has a way to identify it (e.g ID column). 
Very simple built, source code is < 70 loc and has full test coverage. 
Easy to tap into any project without must learning curve or code breakage. Easy to remove as well.
VERY unobtrusive.

== Contributing to Rfizzy
 
* Check out the latest develop to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/my_feature or bugfix/ branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
